\begin{abstract}
With the increase in number of educational institutions, industrial growth and an advanced technology in terms of both software and hardware,  number of students and employees using laptop has been increasing predominantly. While problems attested to laptop usage such as, reddening of eyes due to glare and issues as such, are answered by various laptop companies through some changes in hardware and software. Other problems, which lead to physical strain or fatigue of human body are addressed a little by these companies, while a major portion of such issues are left to explore.  It is by exploring such  issues, idea of laptop stand emerged.  Many small scale companies flourished on this idea, creating wonderful and brilliant designs, among which, most of them are in the market as well established products.
